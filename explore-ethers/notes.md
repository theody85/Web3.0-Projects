    /*
        0x - Prefix representing the rest of the message is in hexadecimal
        f867 - RLP Encoding indicating a list of 107 (0x6b) bytes is coming up next
        80 - This is the nonce value (0) encoded in RLP
        84 - RLP Encoding telling us a string of length 4 is coming next
        3b9aca00 - The gasPrice that the sender is willing to pay, 1000000000 Wei or 1 Gwei.
        82 - RLP Encoding telling us a string of length 2 is coming next
        5208 - The gasLimit of the transaction which is the max amount willing to be paid, 21000 Wei.
        94 - RLP Encoding telling us a string of length 20 is coming next
        dd0dc6…14de92 - The to address, which is a string of 20 hexadecimal characters
        88 - RLP Encoding telling us a string of length 8 is coming next
        0de0b6b3a7640000 - The amount in Wei being sent over this transaction (1000000000000000000 in decimal)
        80 - Indicates that no data is being sent on this transaction. This is a value transfer, not a contract call. A contract call would use this field to invoke methods on the contract with parameters.
        1b - This indicates whether the public key is on the positive side of the y-axis or negative, often referred to as the v value of the signature. This value makes signature recovery easier since the secp256k1 elliptic curve is symmetrical over the y-axis. Ever since EIP-155 was introduced in the Spurious Dragon Hard Fork, this value can also indicate the chain.
        a0 - RLP Encoding telling us a string of length 32 is coming next
        f503c1f…a323e9b - One of the coordinates of the digital signature known as r.
        a0 - RLP Encoding telling us a string of length 32 is coming next
        2711bd…32dd7a4 - The other coordinate of the digital signature known as s.
